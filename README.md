# Optimization of Liquid State Machines for Speech Recognition

## AIM
To improve the Reservoir through BPTT, Evolutionary Optimization, or other such techniques.

## Overview
This repository would contain learning work and experiments on **Spiking Neural Networks** and **Liquid State Machines (LSM)** using **SNNTorch** and **Tonic**

## Current Objectives
1. Learn SNNTorch / SpikingJelly
2. Learn about BPTT
3. Try to create a working MNIST classifier or replicate previous work in the paper using LSMs (TI-46)
4. Then try to optimize the reservoir.
